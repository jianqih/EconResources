# EconResources

- It contains some useful resources in economics.

<!-- - Based on the rapid development of computer and internet, we could discover various learning material on the internet. But it also needs to judge the quality and fitness of them when we are flooded with plenty of materials.  -->
- Some resources are friendly with Mandarin-speaking users like me.
